# Superresolution-of-Bathymetric-Data
This repository contains the code and neural networks that have been used to gain the results in my paper "Super-Resolution of Bathymetric Data Using Diffusion Models". The paper can be found Here:xxxxx

This work is also a direct extension of J.Shims et.al work so alot of the code is taken from their amazing work. Here you can find their [paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Shim_Diffusion-Based_Signed_Distance_Fields_for_3D_Shape_Generation_CVPR_2023_paper.html) and their [repository](https://github.com/Kitsunetic/SDF-Diffusion?tab=readme-ov-file)
